# 🚀 Multi-File Upload Implementation for Complaint Portal

## ✅ Implementation Summary

I have successfully updated the complaint portal to support **multiple file uploads** with enhanced user experience and admin management capabilities. Here's what has been implemented:

---

## 🔧 Backend Changes

### ✅ Database Structure
- **Already Supported**: The `client_complaints` table has an `evidence_files` JSON column that stores multiple files
- **No Migration Required**: The existing database structure fully supports multiple files

### ✅ Model Updates (ClientComplaint.php)
- **Casting**: `evidence_files` is cast as an array automatically
- **Methods Available**:
  - `hasEvidence()` - Check if complaint has evidence files
  - `getEvidenceCount()` - Get total number of evidence files

### ✅ Controller Support (ClientComplaintController.php)
- **Multi-file Processing**: Handles array of uploaded files
- **File Storage**: Each file is stored with metadata (original name, size, mime type, path)
- **Download Support**: Individual file download by index
- **Validation**: File type, size, and count validation
